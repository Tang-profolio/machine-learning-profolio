# machine-learning-profolio

1. Decision Tree project: predicting political party house-vote-84.data from UCI dataset.
   Building ID3 classifier from the scratch and compare with ski-learn libary.

2. Netural Network Project. Implementing MLP from scratch.  Dataset: pima-indians-diabetes
   a) Including the single perceptron, multiple perceptrons, the network itself, back-propagation to update the weights, and calculating the error rate.
   b) Implemented the backprop algorithm (as a class) and did the tests and plotting the accuracy graphs next for two UCI datasets.
   c) Writing the python code that models everything that is happening inside each node of the algorithm, making it all sync with each other, updating the weights, etc.
   
3. Stock Market Prediction using different machine learning algorithm. Dataset: UCI dow-jones index dataset.
   Including data preparation and using apply both from classfication and regression.
